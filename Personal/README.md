 # The Use and Abuse of Biology
 *An Anthropological Critique of Sociobiology* by Marshall Sahlins

Under the sociobiological framework, war is explained as the individual male aggression in patriarcal nations.
 > Meanwhile, in this resolution of the concrete instance to an abstract reason, everything distinctively cultural about the act has been allowed to escape. We can never get back to its emperical specifications--who actually fights who, where, when, how and why--because all these properties have been dissolved in the biological characterization. It is as Sartre says, "a bath of sulfuric acid." ... Biology offers us merely an enormous intellectual void. __pp.15__
