Work and description of assignments for my fifth semester at WKU

## Motivation

In the past, I have made these repositories private. The intention was simple, I was working across multiple computers on the same homework and version control was helpful for writing intensive assignments where I could track my thought process over time. A simple ```git push``` before bed and ```git fetch``` on another computer the next was an apt workflow for me. Now, valuing education more, I find many of the ways that people gatekeep knowledge to be revolting (think paywalls and forcing students into massive debt for so-called “public” education). I also find that the content for my classes, outside of textbooks, appears one month and disappears in four. The transient nature of this information is through no fault of my professors as they are only using the technology they are asked to use. However, my university believes they should not invest in larger servers for archiving this information, expecting students to do it either in their heads or on their own. Since I find myself sometimes wishing I had ‘kept that paper/textbook’, hoping to relive the experience of learning something I once knew better, here enters this repository: An archive of what I have learned, how I learned it, for myself.

## Structure and Presentation

The presentation of information for each class is still in the works as it can often take most of the semester to find the general mode of the class and thus best structure.

## Classes

The classes taken include Chemistry 330: Quantitative Analysis; Chemistry 342: Organic Chemistry 2; Chemistry 343: Organic Chemistry 2 Lab; Film 105: Film Appreciation; Sociology 270: Comm, Env & Dev
