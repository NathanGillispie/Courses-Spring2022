**Office Hours:** I will be available Mondays and Wednesdays between 9:00&mdash;10:00 AM and between 12:30&mdash;1:00 PM or by appointment on Zoom.

**WKU Catalog Description:** Examines the causes, dynamics, and consequences of socio-economic change for people, how they live in communities, and how they relate to the natural world. Survey course for "Community, Environment, & Development" concentration.

## **COURSE DESCRIPTION:**
How can we get along better with each other and the planet? The central task of the study of community and environmental sociology is answering this question.

Each week in this introductory course, we take up a different dimension of what stands in the way of greater togetherness, and how we might turn it into a point of connection and belongingness with one another.  Key topics include community organizing, local food systems, energy transitions, environmental justice, resource dependence, and sustainable development.

## **COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES:**

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

 - Connect individual and seemingly isolated lives to a broader social and historical context.
 - Understand how social science arguments are constructed and evaluated.
 - Learn and practice the core elements of sociological reasoning, including making connections between a social phenomenon and its larger context; evaluating the 'situated' nature of knowledge; and recognizing the paradigms, or knowledge frameworks, that structure our thinking about social issues.
 - Gain experience critically evaluating various sources of knowledge and data about social issues.
 - Become familiar with key concepts such as: 'community,' 'development,' 'environmental justice,' 'sustainability,' and 'globalization,' and learn how these concepts are involved in contemporary debates about what is just and desirable for the places where we live and the world as a whole.
 - Become familiar with actors in the social practices, processes, and institutions that affect our communities and the environment, including government, corporations, transnational institutions and social movements.
 - Develop skills and frameworks for analyzing how social processes affect disparately different groups of people.
 - Make connections between sociological theories and concepts and your own experiences.


This course also fulfills the Local to Global Component of the Colonnade Program's Connections Section.
This course will help you attain these general education goals--by the end of the course, you will be able to:

 - Recognize the interconnections of events and processes unfolding in different localities around the world.
 - Analyze the tensions between the projects of local communities and economic globalization.
 - Identify the consequences of decision-making for various localities and developments at the global scale.
 - Consider and evaluate various alternatives for how everyday life might be organized.

The university also sees the Connections courses of the Colonnade program as the place to demonstrate mastery of the skills developed in WKU's Quality Enhancement Plan, entitled "Evidence and Argument."  Through this plan, WKU students will bring evidence and argument to life through written, oral, and visual means so that they can apply and adapt these skills to their professional, social, and personal lives. So at the end of this course, WKU students will also demonstrate the ability to:

 - Gather sound and relevant evidence to address an issue \(Evidence-Gathering\).
 - Analyze assembled evidence \(Sense-making\).
 - Articulate a logical and supported argument based on this analysis \(Argumentation\).

## **REQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS:**
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Electronic copies will be available on our Blackboard website.</span>

I want to clarify how I hope you will approach the readings. First, be critical of what you are reading, drawing upon your own experiences, and other knowledge you have acquired throughout your education.  I have chosen many readings precisely because they are provocative, and because they may disagree or amplify one another. If you find yourself strongly disagreeing with a particular reading, that's fine; indeed, I encourage strong disagreement. However, if you disagree, you must clarify in your mind the <span style="text-decoration: underline">reasons and evidence</span> upon which you are basing your disagreement. We will get a lot farther with discussion than with debate.

At the same time, you should keep an open mind. Listen to what the readings have to say. Think about what experiences you may have had and reading you have done that may corroborate the course readings.  Give yourself time to reflect on the information offered in the readings. These are not readings to be run through rapidly.  Take your time with them; allow yourself to enter into a kind of conversation with them.

When reading you should consider the following:

 - What are the main themes/arguments in this reading?
 - What evidence does the author provide to support her/his argument?
 - How does this reading relate to other readings we have done?
 - What are the strengths and weaknesses of this argument and any data supporting it?  Are terms defined clearly and used consistently? \(If not, what problems does this create?\)
 - Are terms defined and used the same way as in the other readings?  Would other authors we have read agree/disagree with this argument?  Why?
 - What additional questions does this reading raise for you?  \(Or put another way: if you and the author were stranded on a desert isle, what question would you most like to ask him or her besides "Do you have a boat?\)?
 - How could you use the ideas in addressing real world problems? 

## **COURSE ORGANIZATION: **

This 3-credit hour course will require approximately three hours of direct faculty instruction each week. In addition, you may expect to spend approximately six hours on out-of-class student work for this course each week for approximately 15 weeks. Out-of-class work may include but is not limited to: required reading, online training module completion, written assignments, and studying for exams.

# **COURSE NORMS:**

 - I expect you to respect one another. We are all Hilltoppers. We take care of one another, our hill, our community, and beyond. Everybody is trying to understand the material and how it fits with their values and experiences. Give folks time to process. Each of us may have strongly differing opinions on the various topics of class discussions. Diverse ideas and views are important to the class, and the orderly questioning of others' ideas, including mine, is encouraged and welcomed. Everyone's arguments can use polish. The only way we improve is by continuously re-examining our evidence and our argument. However, it is imperative that everyone be respectful of the each other. Couch your feedback to try to help the others understand. Focus on the evidence and argument presented, not the speaker's personal characteristics. You should expect that if your conduct during discussions seriously disrupts the atmosphere of mutual respect I expect in this class, you will not be permitted to participate further.
 - Please do not wait until the end of the semester to seek assistance when you are having difficulties with the course. Please use my office hours or contact me to arrange a time to meet. I am more than willing to arrange a time that works for both of us. I'm usually in my office, but I'm teaching four classes this term so I'll often be recording lectures and/or grading. **The best way to reach me is email. Please put your name and the course number in the subject line of the email. I'll try to respond within 24 hours.**
 - If you prefer to be called a different name than what is indicated on the class roster, please let me know. Also, feel free to correct me on your preferred gender pronoun. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.
 - The United States Department of Education requires WKU's Office of Financial Aid to determine if a student who receives financial aid and fails to earn a passing grade in a course actually attended and/or completed the course. If you earn an F, your last date of attendance will be reported to the United Stated Department of Education. If this date is at or before the 60% point of the term \(in this semester, March 27\), this may require you to pay back any financial aid funds received for this course.
 - All students are strongly encouraged to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Out of respect for the health and safety of the WKU community and in adherence with CDC guidelines and practices of all public universities and colleges in Kentucky, the University requires that a cloth face covering \(reusable or disposable\) that covers both the nose and mouth must be worn at all times when in public areas within all buildings. Students must properly wear face coverings while in class regardless of the room size or the nature of the classroom activities. Students who fail to wear a face covering as required will be in violation of the WKU Student Code of Conduct and will be asked to comply or will face disciplinary action, including possible dismissal from the University. Accommodations can be requested in special cases through the Student Accessibility and Resource Center \([SARC](https://www.wku.edu/sarc/)\): 270-745-5004 \(voice\), 270-745-3030 \(TTY\), or 270-288-0597 \(video\).  
 
> All students must immediately report a positive Covid-19 test result or close contact with a person who has tested positive to the Covid-19 Assistance Line at 270-745-2019. The assistance line is available to answer questions regarding any Covid-19 related issue. This guidance is subject to change based on requirements set forth by public health agencies or the office of the governor. Please refer to the Healthy on the Hill website for the most current information. [www.wku.edu/healthyonthehill](https://www.wku.edu/healthyonthehill)

# **SYLLABUS CHANGE POLICY:**

The syllabus for any class is a road map. The readings in the course calendar are places we are scheduled to visit.  Anyone who has taken a preplanned road trip or vacation knows that the trip is not fun unless you stop at the interesting roadside attractions even though they might divert from your original route or time table.  It's the process of getting there that is fun and relaxing and intriguing.  In that light, I reserve the right to alter the standards and requirements set forth in this syllabus at any time. Notice of such changes will be by announcement on Blackboard and/or by email notice.
