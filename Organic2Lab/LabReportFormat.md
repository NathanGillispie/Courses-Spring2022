# Lab Report Format

Hand-Written reports are required and submitted in person.

 - *No Abstract* 
 - Intro/background: Write about the overall purpose of the experiment and anything of note about the experiment (e.g. cis/trans isomerism). If the experiment is named after someone, that is also a good source for background information. Please be sure to include an appropriate reaction scheme. It may be hand-drawn and included in the document if necessary, but please be sure that the picture is appropriately formatted and clear. (Keep in mind the difference between a reaction scheme and a mechanism.) Provide a brief explanation / description of the scheme.
 - Experimental procedure: You will not need too much detail. This is just a retelling of the procedure. Please try to keep it to a single paragraph, if possible.
Results: Please include your final yield, theoretical yield, percent yield, and limiting reagent calculations for the theoretical yield. Each lab report should include all four of these and the associated math involved in the calculations.
> - For the limiting reagent calculations, this will involve calculating the moles used of the main reactants (not catalysts or solvents); show calculations for both reactants.
 - Discussion (discussing the results): Please tell me the merits of your yield (what did you accomplish / did you obtain the desired product?), whether it was good or bad, what may have gone wrong, what can be done to improve the yield, etc.
Spectroscopic analysis: I have posted  (or will post very soon ) a spectrum of your product on blackboard. Please label the peaks appropriately. Draw the structure on the spectra and label which peaks belong to which hydrogen. Include a spectroscopic analysis section describing each peak. Please try to keep this section to a paragraph as well, if possible.
> - The easiest way is to draw the structure, label the hydrogen with a letter, and label the corresponding peak on the NMR with the same letter (similar to what was done in Organic I Lab).
 - Conclusion: State the objective of the experiment along with the resulting yields and brief summarized explanation of your results.
